## Paranoia

# Paranoia is a multiplayer shooter game. 

- First start the game server by running "python server/server.py". 
- Then join a game as a player by running "python client.py" in the client/ directory. 

When you first join, if you are the first player you will have to wait for other players to join before the game starts. Once four players have joined the game will start. You win the game if you can destroy all of your opponents before they destroy you.
